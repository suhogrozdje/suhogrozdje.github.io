so long my woman\
so long dear friend\
ill confess to a stranger\
im a mere shell of a man\
n that i feel as if id been strangled\
left alone to rot\
\
to be worthy \
of my wine\
aint no high bar \
to reach\
(you dont no more)\
\
and i drilled through your temple tonight\
you gave in like dough\
dont know who it hurt more\
\
the game of who's more real is done with\
your shame i never wanted to win\
this time youre the mortar, im the pestle\
oh baby should i crush my nuts on you\
\
my nuts on you\
diamonds reflect in blue\
the dollar's on me\
oh darlin, i cum on your ghee
