title: tinnitus
---
youve been trying to find\
a silent place to rewind\
end to end, from the beginning\
it dont even exist\
the baseline of your hearing, jinxed\
the constant chirm of tinnitus\
well do you still\
stop and think\
if youve ever had the grip on the bull\
that births are to be violent\
and whether theres cracks in your concrete\
a nasty itch\
no dirt behind the nails\
no progress or process\
where do you go my lovely\
i wanna know\
nothing and all in your command
