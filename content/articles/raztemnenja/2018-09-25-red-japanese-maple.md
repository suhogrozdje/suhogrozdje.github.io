red japanese maple \
in its short lived autumn scarlet foliage\
i was sure it had been used out\
that it had begun \
to lose its mass \
to lose its pull\
\
preparing itself for the winter\
trying to find its way through\
alive, alive\
\
the inconspicuous stipules of the petioles\
i now recognize as such\
when your subtle rays\
are laid on the eyes\
and the burning cold\
lifts off my spine\
\
its off, dear oh yours\
that wrong step is around again\
all's been seen in autumn\
winter come as you please\
\
conclusions hypothesized\
romanticised, idealized\
keep them under an open eye\
they'll pound at your stump mercilessly
