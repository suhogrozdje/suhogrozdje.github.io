title: 'Transparence'
abstract: ""

I am readily see-through with my dread-glamourizing and self-exaltation. My established defense lest a reader would not be able to spew criticism, is of course, an act of self-preservation. Instant cynism, a form of offense in midst of defensive sorrow. I wish I was special. So fucking special. But my commas lack correct placement. I misuse words.

My grammar, my choice. Language is a fluid thing; that's how I apologise my inarticulateness. If you're still here, you probably want it raw, want me to tell you a way to do this, to slide through it and tap it like a pro. You want it raw? Become a vegan and cry your vegetables into germination; them vegans certainly feel satisfied with themselves. But that's not really what you want, is it -- you don't really crave to be persuaded into wellbeing, otherwise you'd be reading some spirit science cult facebook page and feeding on their motivational quotes that aggravate your condition, not my tractats. You want it real but you don't feel genuine -- well, I am not either. I've got numerous identities to choose from and pretend to be.

I don't deem lightly of this issue, obviously. I don't proclaim to have it down and yes I do exalt myself for not thinking that I do. If you've come this far, you're most likely looking for general nonexisting purpose and I'm not here to tell you there isn't one. If you wish to think santa exists, that's fine with me. Also, if you wish to think there isn't a horse to tackle, I'm also fine with you staying ignorant.
