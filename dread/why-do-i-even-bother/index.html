One of the things that can prevent you from miserably biting into the pity of conforming to the established standard of what should be projected as an <em>idea of you</em> is closing yourself off – e.g. <strong>not</strong> writing an opinionated blog, deleting your social network accounts and living your life without the burden of day-to-day garbage scrolling. It’s not a novel thing to say that what we are doing is unhealthy, mostly because we get rewarded with dopamine kicks for doing absolutely nothing but swiping your two fingers against a touchpad or the middle one against the wheel, and dopamine kicks for the successfully portrayed illusion of who you are that comes in form of a <em>like</em>.<p>What is mostly expected from the writer (in this case, me) is to serve precisely the idea of themselves that they have been marinating in, patting their backs with offering only the misguiding image <em>under which they feel good about themselves</em>, appealing to the reader that they should think good of the writer as well.

For those of you who know me, I rest assured it is not so, acknowledging you know of my mistakes. These mistakes obviously never take place in a portrayal such as this one; let’s say I’ve made a large misdeed some time ago – I will be prepared to talk about it semi-openly when I will feel that enough time has passed since the wrongdoing that I can <em>claim</em> that it is not a part of me anymore, that I’ve <em>outgrown</em> my bad trait. More importantly, not only would I have a problem with talking about my mistakes, but I’d feel tiny whenever I’d get caught in the gutter of remembering <em>who I really am</em> and that a part of me stinks immensely of “non-<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/integrity/">integrity</a>”, which brings up an intense feeling of shame.
