Become a vegan and cry your vegetables into germination; them vegans certainly feel satisfied with themselves.

Sandman puts down people – again, yes I’m that much better than them for knowin this – to being attached to their mental conceivements, then it’s difficult to let go of them. Reasonable, as we all have the need to feel good about ourselves. Let me elaborate; because it’s <strong>our</strong> idea and <strong>we</strong> came up with it, we need to presuade ourselves and others that we are right about whatever it is we’re talking about. We even involve the Truth (yes I believe in that sort of santa, more about that some other time) into our stinking mess of self-security, which gives off the level of our insecurity. We are always craving to be in the right, to hit the nail on its head with our idea, or at least to think that we did and to make others think we did.<p>When a certain amount of doubt in oneself is present, there is a lesser chance that we do this. This doubt should in practice be an internal dialogue that one makes, and I mean that quite literally, back and forth, asking questions and try your best to answer. And if it doesn’t feel like a struggle with really rare and occasional moments of ease, you’re most likely leaning onto your satisfaction with yourself too much.
