# Generated files

These are the files that are generated with `npm run generate` as defined in `package.json` on dev branch. These files actually belong to a subdirectory `dist` and are pushed to `master` branch with `git subtree push --prefix dist origin master `.

See `deploy.sh` script on `dev` for more info.
