  "body": "<p>Firstly, it’s worth mentioning that I am a physics graduate who is currently on his way of getting a master’s in mathematics. So this blog will hopefully be heavily permeated with topics from geometry and topology, algebra and analysis.</p>\n<p>This category will include short scribblings about my involvement in mathematics. What this mostly means is that I will be discussing mathematical concepts and their connection to physics, the synthesis of the two being called <em>mathematical physics</em>. I will sometimes get involved and talk about specific definitions, lemmas, theorems, proofs; at other times, I will be a physicist and only use mathematics to describe a phenomenon. Forgive me if I start talking about philosophy of mathematics at times though – I will strive to perform better than an average person at your local bar.</p>\n<p>Here’s a short test to see whether MathJax works correctly. An inline bra-ket: $p_e = \\Abs{\\braket{e|\\psi(t)}}^2 = \\sin^2\\Omega t$, a Dirac particle creation operator:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\bar\\psi(x) = \\int \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^3\\vec p}{(2\\pi)^3}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2E_{\\vec p}}}\\sum_s\\big(b_{\\vec p}^s\\ \\bar v^s(\\vec p)\\,\\eul^{-ipx} + {a_{\\vec p}^s}^\\dagger\\ u^s (\\vec p)\\,\\eul^{-ipx}\\big),\n\\end{equation}</p>\n<p>and Pauli matrices:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\sigma_x&amp;=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 &amp; 1 \\\\\n1 &amp; 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n\\sigma_y&amp;=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 &amp; -i \\\\\ni &amp; 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n\\sigma_z&amp;=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 &amp; 0 \\\\\n0 &amp; -1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{split}\n\\label{pauli}\n\\end{equation}</p>\n<p>Trying out definitions, lemmas, theorems, proofs:</p>\n<div class=\"definition\" data-title=\"Convexity\">\n  A set $C$ is <i>convex</i> if for all $x,y \\in C$ and for all $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ the point $\\alpha x + (1-\\alpha) y \\in C$.\n</div>\n<p>Note that markdown <em>doesn’t</em> work in html tags. Watch out for gt/lt signs in theorems. Also, I’m using a reference to \\ref{pauli}</p>\n<p>Now that we’ve defined convexity, let’s move to <strong>arihtmetics</strong> (markdown works here again). Let’s add a named theorem.</p>\n<div class=\"theorem\" data-title=\"Fermat's last theorem\">\n  There are no three natural numbers $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $x^n + y^n = z^n$, where $n &gt; 2$.\n</div>\n<div class=\"proof\">\n  Yeah right. Still, I make a q.e.d. sign, to see if it works.\n</div>\n<p>If I now insert a second definition, it should follow in numerical order.</p>\n<div class=\"definition\">\n  A triangle is called <i>equilateral</i> if its sides are equal.\n</div>\n"
